\begin{Define}
  \begin{define}
    If $f_1: \Sigma_1^* \rightarrow L$ and $f_2: \Sigma_2^* \rightarrow L$ are proof systems for $L$, then $f_2$ p-simulates $f_1$ provided there is a function $g:\Sigma_1^* \rightarrow \Sigma_2^*$ such that $f_2(g(x)) = f_1(x)$ for all $x.$
  \end{define}
\end{Define}

It's easy to show that p-simulation is a transitive reflexive relation, so that its symmetric closure is an equivalence relation. If we require the function $g$ is bounded in length by a polynomial in the length of its argument and a proof system $f_2$ for $L$ p-simulates a polynomially bounded proof system $f_1$ for $L$, then $f_2$ is also polynomially bounded.
