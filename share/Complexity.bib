Requiring essentially no background apart from mathematical maturity, the book can be used as a reference for self-study for anyone interested in complexity, including physicists, mathematicians, and other scientists, as well as a textbook for a variety of courses and seminars. More than 300 exercises are included with a selected hint set. The book starts with a broad introduction to the field and progresses to advanced results. Contents include: definition of Turing machines and basic time and space complexity classes, probabilistic algorithms, interactive proofs, cryptography, quantum computation, lower bounds for concrete computational models (decision trees, communication complexity, constant depth, algebraic and monotone circuits, proof complexity), average-case complexity and hardness amplification, derandomization and pseudorandom constructions, and the PCP theorem.},

This extends the familiar proof system implicit in the notion of NP in that there the verifier may not toss coins or speak, but only listen and verify. Interactive proof systems may not yield proof in the strict mathematical sense: the "proofs" are probabilistic with an exponentially small, though non-zero chance of error.},

This introduction to algebraic complexity theory for graduate students and researchers in computer science and mathematics features concrete examples that demonstrate the application of geometric techniques to real world problems. Written by a noted expert in the field, it offers numerous open questions to motivate future research. Complexity theory has rejuvenated classical geometric questions and brought different areas of mathematics together in new ways.

First, we characterise the classes PPADS, PPAD, SOPL by unary-SA, unary-NS, and Reversible Resolution, respectively.

These include the notion of “unique solutions”, the formulation of “gap problems” as capturing various approximation tasks, the identiﬁcation of complete problems (especially for the class SZK), the indication of separations between certain computational resources, and the enabling of presentations that better distill the essence of various proofs.},

	abstract = {For every known NP-complete problem, the number of solutions of its instances varies over a large range, from zero to exponentially many. It is therefore natural to ask if the inherent intractability of NP-complete problems is caused by this wide variation. We give a negative answer to this question using the notion of randomized polynomial time reducibility. We show that the problems of distinguishing between instances of SAT having zero or one solution, or of finding solutions to instances of SAT having a unique solution, are as hard as SAT, under randomized reductions. Several corollaries about the difficulty of specific problems follow. For example, computing the parity of the number of solutions of a SAT formula is shown to be NP-hard, and deciding if a SAT formula has a unique solution is shown to be DP-hard, under randomized reduction. Central to the study of cryptography is the question as to whether there exist NPproblems whose instances have solutions that are unique but are hard to find. Our result can be interpreted as strengthening the belief that such problems exist.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the generation of tight equivalent representations for mixedinteger zero-one programming problems. For the linear case, we propose a technique which first converts the problem into a nonlinear, polynomial mixed-integer zero-one problem by multiplying the constraints with some suitable d-degree polynomial factors involving the n binary variables, for any given d E (0, ..., n\vphantom{\{}\}, and subsequently linearizes the resulting problem through appropriate variable transformations. As d varies from zero to n, we obtain a hierarchy of relaxations spanning from the ordinary linear programming relaxation to the convex hull of feasible solutions. The facets of the convex hull of feasible solutions in terms of the original problem variables are available through a standard projection operation. We also suggest an alternate scheme for applying this technique which gives a similar hierarchy of relaxations, but involving fewer “complicating” constraints. Techniques for tightening intermediate level relaxations, and insights and interpretations within a disjunctive programming framework are also presented. The methodology readily extends to multilinear mixed-integer zero-one polynomial programming problems in which the continuous variables appear linearly in the problem.},

A question we would like to answer (but have not been able to) is whether this function has a polynomial bound for some proof system. (This question is motivated below.) Our results here are relative results.
            
              In §§2 and 3 we indicate that all standard Hilbert type systems (or Frege systems, as we call them) and natural deduction systems are equivalent, up to application of a polynomial, as far as minimum proof length goes. In §4 we introduce
              extended Frege
              systems, which allow introduction of abbreviations for formulas. Since these abbreviations can be iterated, they eliminate the need for a possible exponential growth in formula length in a proof, as is illustrated by an example (the pigeonhole principle). In fact, Theorem 4.6 (which is a variation of a theorem of Statman) states that with a penalty of at most a linear increase in the number of lines of a proof in an extended Frege system, no line in the proof need be more than a constant times the length of the formula proved.},
