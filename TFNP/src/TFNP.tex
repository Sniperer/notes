\subsubsection{Function problem}
\begin{Define}
\begin{define}
 A functional problem $\boldsymbol{P}$ is defined by a relation R over strings of an arbitrary alphabet $\Sigma:$ $\boldsymbol{R} \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*.$
\end{define}
\end{Define}

An algorithm solves $\boldsymbol{P}$ if for every input $x$ such that there exists a $y$ satisfying $(x,y) \in \boldsymbol{R},$ the algorithm produces one such $y,$ and if there are no such $y$, it rejects. The output for function problems is more complex than that of a decision problem, which means it's not simply 'yes' or 'no'.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \fp/: the set of binary relations for which there is a polynomial time algorithm that, given $x$, finds some $y$ for which $R(x,y)$ holds.
\item \fnp/: the set of binary relations for which there is a polynomial time algorithm that can determine whether $R(x,y)$ holds given both $x$ and $y.$
\item \tfnp/: a subset of \fnp/ for which are total relation.
\end{enumerate}
